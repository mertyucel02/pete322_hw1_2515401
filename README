PETE-322 DRILLING ENGINEERING 2
Homework Assignment-1: Wellbore Hydraulics Algorithm Design
Objective:
Design an algorithm to calculate wellbore hydraulics parameters including standpipe pressure,
Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD), Bit Pressure Drop, Horsepower per square inch (HSI), Jet Impact
Force, and Optimum Nozzle Sizes based on given inputs such as mud properties, nozzle sizes, fluid flow
rates, drill string components and sizes, and wellbore dimensions (casing and open hole).
Instructions:
1. Develop a detailed algorithm that takes into account the various inputs and calculates the required
parameters for wellbore hydraulics.
2. Utilize relevant equations and formulas for each parameter calculation.
3. Ensure the algorithm is efficient and capable of handling different scenarios and input variations.
4. Provide clear explanations and comments within the algorithm code to enhance understanding.
5. Test the algorithm with sample input data to verify its accuracy and functionality.
Inputs:
- Mud properties (e.g., viscosity, density, dial readings)
- Nozzle sizes
- Fluid flow rates
- Drill string components (e.g., drill pipe, drill collars) and their lengths and sizes
- Hole depth (both True Vertical Depth (TVD) and Measured Depth (MD))
- Other relevant parameters as necessary
Outputs:
1. Standpipe Pressure
2. Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD)
3. Bit Pressure Drop
4. Horsepower per square inch (HSI)
5. Jet Impact Force
6. Optimum Nozzle Sizes
Deliverables:
1. Wellbore Hydraulics Algorithm code written in a programming language of your choice (e.g., Excel,
Python, MATLAB).
2. Documentation explaining the logic, equations, and calculations used in the algorithm.
3. Test cases demonstrating the functionality and accuracy of the algorithm with sample input data.
Additional Notes:
- Try to ensure proper error handling and validation techniques are implemented within the algorithm
code.
- Consider the impact of various factors such as hole geometry, mud properties, and drill string
configuration on the wellbore hydraulics calculations.
- Aim for clarity and readability in both the algorithm code and documentation to facilitate
understanding for users.
- Submit your completed assignment by the specified deadline.
